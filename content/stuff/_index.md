# here lie mismatched pieces of my mind

{Disclaimer: You probably stumbled here by accident, this is a cave for personal ramblings, i hope your day is bearable today.}

have you ever come home from a nice evening and felt ridiculous, the very thought is full of your self-centeredness, but hear me out here: you come home, but there's nothing to come back to, right? as if, everything about you exists only in the context of the external world, and as soon as you're between four walls that are caving in - you, you just repeat these rituals, these vague twitches that your brain does, which it's used to. you sit there examining every random piece of information your head lets you, you feel like a psychopath, but that's a romanticised version of what you do feel. mostly, nuisance. 

i always feel like, the only way i can come close to summing myself up is collect every single thing that made me feel something (spare me the part where you say this is overdone and we have no original experiences), i guess i share mutual experiences with every other jane doe on the road, but the exact collection, the exact set of mine will probably not be the same as others. so you make playlists, instead of songs, sure hundreds of sad edgy people heard the same song you play when you thrust your head on the pillow trying to get your brain to shutup, but maybe your specific playlist is a little different right? i really hope it is. i think wanting to have original thoughts or experiences isn't totally about wanting to be better than other people in some sense, it's a desperate attempt against the erasure of your self.

anyhow, i miss writing, i hate forgetting things, it feels like losing life, quite literally, you have this thought and you have opinions about it and two months later you forget that you were the person who thought that. it makes me unbelievably frustrated. it's very difficult to write in a journal, so i'm writing here,,,

since i'm undressing on the internet now, here goes nothing:
