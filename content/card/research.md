Summer 2020 | Indian Statistical Institute

I spent the summer working on with Prof. Ujjwal Maulik and Prof. Sanghamitra Bandyopadhya (Director, ISI Kolkata) on Non Linear Dimensionality Reduction-Algorithms based on canonical feature extraction techniques such as PCA and LDA applied through Graph Embeddings.

January 2020 | Semester Long Project - Natural Language Processing

Developed an Unsupervised, graph-based algorithm for Keyphrase Extraction that exploits syntactic relations using dependency parsing, augmented with local text attributes. We reconstruct dependency trees in a Hyperbolic metric space to locate keywords, further ranked by statistical NLP features.\[[pdf](https://mjhajharia.com/keyword.pdf)\]
