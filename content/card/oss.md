- I’m enthusiastic about open source and Probabilistic Programming. I spend some time learning Bayesian Inference and working with PyMC as a core contributor. 

- I deeply care about making open source more accessible and inclusive. Have a look at pymc-data-umbrella.xyz to checkout the webinars and sprint we’re organising in collaboration with Data Umbrella to help people contribute to PyMC.

- During Google Summer of Code'21, I worked on Extending Bayesian Time Series Models of PyMC: Implementing a new class of models - SARIMAX, Kalman filter and state space implementation. Alongside, I’m working on Pedagogical notebooks exploring the econometric applications of these models.[[Check the Project here]](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2021/projects/5431531543199744)

- Here's a recent talk at PyData about Hierarchical Bayesian models in PyMC.
