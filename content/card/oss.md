- I’m enthusiastic about open source and Probabilistic Programming. I spend some time learning Bayesian Inference and working with [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc) as a core contributor.

- I deeply care about making open source more accessible and inclusive. We're organising a couple of events and a sprint in collaboration with Data Umbrella to help people contribute to [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc), for more information see: [pymc-data-umbrella.xyz](https://pymc-data-umbrella.xyz/)

- During Google Summer of Code, I worked on Extending Bayesian Time Series Models of [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc): Implementing a new class of models - SARIMAX, Kalman filter and state space implementation. [Check the Project here for details](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2021/projects/5431531543199744).
