Your daughter is ugly. 
She knows loss intimately, 
carries whole cities in her belly. 

As a child, relatives wouldn't hold her. 
She was splintered wood and sea water. 
They said she reminded them of the war. 

On her fifteenth birthday you taught her 
how to tie her hair like rope 
and smoke it over burning frankincense. 

You made her gargle rosewater 
and while she coughed, said 
macaanto girls like you shouldn't smell 
of lonely or empty. 

You are her mother. 
Why did you not warn her, 
hold her like a rotting boat 
and tell her that men will not love her 
if she is covered in continents, 
if her teeth are small colonies, 
if her stomach is an island 
if her thighs are borders? 

What man wants to lay down 
and watch the world burn 
in his bedroom? 

Your daughter's face is a small riot, 
her hands are a civil war, 
a refugee camp behind each ear, 
a body littered with ugly things 

but God, 
doesn't she wear 
the world well.
