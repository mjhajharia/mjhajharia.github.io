here's what I remember  
there’s a troubled lady in my head,  
walking up and down   
all of the alleys visited only by the dead.  
sixteen circles around time, with a noose,  
she measures its threads like rosary beads. 
 
epitaphs are the morning prayer,  
blood till break o break  is the national anthem.  
she would burn a fire on her palm everyday,  
just to make sure she’s still flammable;  
i try to dig up skin for her but she sits there -  
a souvenir of doom. cautious! soak in the child’s crying;  
what if he turns stillborn over your blink.   

today mother is screaming at a child already under the sod.  
she believed i’d learn to swim if i keep drowning for too long,  
perhaps something women learn from marriage.  
i’d put my fingers on the stove,  
waiting for my skin to learn how not to catch fire.  
now, i don’t function unless i’m tiptoeing in a burning room  
with an acetylene bucket on my head;   
i turned off the fire alarms, the sirens stop only  
if you softly let them  smother your pulse  
to a beaten clove.  
don’t you dare paint me a senile mustard soup,  
no, i won’t come down mother; all this rage-   
my clenched fists are boisterous serpents now,  
i arrange them on splinters of my elmwood front desk.  

my eyes- boiled beetroots scavenging my flesh;   
squeezed oceans spasm under my skin.  
i’m always out of breath you say,  
so i start licking air off knives-  
your lips haven’t learnt to palate  
the pungent blood on my tongue.  
I bury myself in sand; let the ocean ridge my chest.  
lovers trace their footprints on my neck,   
mother walks on me dragging her nail.  
she lets it dig into my ribs like a fishhook.  
modesty in rusted nails, or so she was taught.  
i fold my limbs, dangle them down the refrigerator.  
three evenings later, mother tries to thaw my brain;  
she places me beside the fireplace.   
my hands are trying not to quiver,   
water isn't allowed to move on its own;   
i must bend only in a vessel,   
must wait for my blood to be funneled out in words,  

bland- i got it ma.   
i got you the word. now stop   
curling your fist in rage,  
my sadness isn’t in foreign language.   
i think it’s my mother tongue,   
you know it all too well.
