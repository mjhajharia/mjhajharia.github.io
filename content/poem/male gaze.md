collection: poetry

men close my palms with pamphlets of desirability,  
all of them begin with pursed lips;  
all of them end with me shrinking.  

i sit by the window and cajole myself with feminist poetry,  
while i let them dress me up with needles;  
i say intricate, they pronounce it delicate.  

now i tiptoe in my skin, i shouldn't make too much noise;  
i'm allowed to scream, only if my head is buried into a pillow.  
mother knowingly nods -   
"women are born with pain built in"  
we exchange a glance smeared with shared helplessness.  

we look away, i think most women  
refuse to acknowledge the enormity of their oppression;  
just the way, trauma survivors forget, to survive.  
 
its too painful to walk with that realization all day long,  
men have a choice - to forget or to forgive,  
for the rest of us,  its survive or not.  

i'm angry, i'm afraid its just sadness;  
but sadness happens to me,  
i decide to be angry, you see i'm tired of things happening to me.  

for once, i want my screams to be mine  
not induced with scars, the ones that men like picasso paint on my back;  
spare me their "revolution", a tale as old as time, men watching women;
