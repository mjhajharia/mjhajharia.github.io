title: "tired, again"
collection: poetry
---
there’s a tired boy outside my window,  
his face flutters with the wind;  
sand waiting to be washed over by the waves.  
it keeps returning, a sigh stuffed in your mouth,  
with alien mannerisms you don’t follow.  
sometimes tired falls down on me-  
a motel bed sheet i clutch after staining the ones at home;   
fall isn’t as beautiful as the poets declare,  
it’s mostly just falling.  

when i put out my wounds on the streets for display,  
it’s not for a passerby to nurse them;  
we’re past that, now i wait for them to shy away,  
to quiver and disappear with all that gaze.  

i hold your hands wrapping mine in plastic gloves,  
i stink of hideousness;   
paperweights on my fingernails, apologies in foreign languages.   
i scream in porcelain jars crammed with glycerin  
till my nose starts bleeding;  
fragile is written in minuscule text  
on the sides of my fingers.  

everyday is an advertisement for death-  
eyes like scalpels, insinuating to be saved;  
in a rusty fall which withers down daffodils.  
it’s all becoming yellow, the saddest colour,  
it sits on my face like a dead albatross;  
holds my poems at gunpoint,  
but everyone likes being held.  

i fill up these shrivelling straws with rotten wine-  
all summer i built a cage for the nightmares,  
only to crumble under a careless stranger’s boots  
clumsily plodding through piles of fall clinkering on the streets.  
the cold compress on my head smells of a white clad nurse:   
the ones that disappear in hospital corridors  
like niceties spiralling into erasure.  

stay, stay, stay   
echoes on my throat like a sick lady with her rosaries;  
smiles, i eat them up-  
just like the horizon swallows the sun.
