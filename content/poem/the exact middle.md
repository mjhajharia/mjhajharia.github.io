title: "the exact middle"
collection: poetry
---

it all began in bright hysteria,  
a purple syrup you swallow;  
the one lovers smear on their palms-  
you might as well call it  
the moment sitting at the edge of a knife,  
legs dangling atop fervent obsession.  

all night i count the days from the beginning,  
in between you whisper - "snap out of it"  
as if there was a road to enter-   
as if insanity comes with instructions.   

it's morning, the dawn is breaking out of my skull,  
i ask you to sit in the exact middle,  
tiptoe on the barbed wire, of not belonging;  
there's a fleck of blood on my fingers,  
i'm wrestling between neurotic fringes.  

all night i mumble "all or nothing",  
i wake up and you're lying headless,  
love at peripheries of delirium always rests like a corpse;  
i bake you a pie, you see, i'm done with the middle;  
you can have it all, so there's nothing left for me.
