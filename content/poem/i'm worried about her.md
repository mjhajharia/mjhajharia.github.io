i'm worried about her  
she hasn't slept in days,  
when she does,  
she's screaming about graveyards in her sleep.  
when she starts talking, it's like looking in a mirror.  

i'm horrified,  
i tell her;  
shush child don't grow up into me,  
i'm nothing but a board of caution.  
we share cigarettes,  
our legs dangling twenty seven stories high;  
i'm trying to tell her about me,  
i'm trying to scare her.  
She's drinking like the world ended last week,  
i'm worried like i'm disposing a bomb;  
but my dress is stitched with grenades,  
so I'm running away from her.  
little sister, wake up;  
burn my clothes and wash over my footprints.  
she keeps tightening her grip on the frills of my dress,  
i'm worried about her.
