title: "Boisterous Emptiness"
collection: poetry
---

emptiness so boisterous,  
knives feather around it;  
that's what i fill my vases with,    
of course there's a white flower  
dangling on top. i lie on the floor  
and trace chandeliers with broken glass,  
be quiet, absolute silence;   
i'll show you the abyss between my palms.  

it keeps growing inwards,  
most days i fill it up with gravel and words.  
do you know about quiet, lull kind-  
the one that stays;  
you know how smokers always smell of cigarettes.  

strangers on the street ask me to look away,  
vacant eyes that dig on their whole being like scalpels of delirium.  
i look down and pavement tiles withdraw,  
you know how sunflowers bend towards light;  
except i'm not the sun and everyone wants to be a sunflower.  

so i'm told ruptures in darkness don't break out into fluorescence,  
it's all just a profound way of saying--  
strangulation is easier than not breathing.  

this sunday i made up a listicle of sad things,  
somebody pointed out "the first item is blank"  
everyone told me the void i carry with me like a water bottle,  
was too fierce--  
so i softened it,  
i smothered it till it was a glob of tears,  
now it's too ugly.  

you don't like a mess, do you.  
let me chisel it up for you,  
is it alright if i serve some with your breakfast;  
sir, take a look at the fucking empty buildings swarming with people--  
look there's the bed-sheet you tuck yourself into,  
unscathed, you hear me;  
why don't you get it, its horrifyingly sad,  
should i start screaming from the top of empire state-  
would you believe it then.  
you can't even hear me,  
i travel in a glass tombstone;  
no wonder all my friends mutter a tender sorry walking past.
