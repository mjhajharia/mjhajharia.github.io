title: "vaine gloire"
collection: poetry
---
my eyes flinch under your footsteps,  
you're stitching a doom on my fingers;  
an infinite needle dips itself in my skin-  
rusted with my dad's vaine gloire.  

you see, my father likes to talk about his forefathers;  
quite literally- forefathers not ancestors.  
history has a habit of forgetting women,  
pride stomps on our necks like a sickle in brine-like summer.  

erasure writes itself on my veins,    
etched to my bones - i carry absence;  
of it all.  

you ask me about ego,  
i fling myself off buildings like a red carousel,  
scale inches of my skin that trespass my body;  
tenderness, has a kind of vanity too-  
rotten tenderness, vanity of not hardening.  

i wear my scars in blasphemous conceit,  
my knuckles hardened with wars against mortar-  
but the cavities never fill up.  

memory is a flood,   
but vanity is always a quicksand puddle,  
the one i keep trying to drown in.  
i'm making an inventory about self-love-  
i cover up the listicle with a bumpy sticker.  

all of it reads "absence", sweet abhorrence;  
for god forbid a woman's vanity wished death upon many many men,  
history watches women put themselves to their grave,   
as apprentices for men who spit out timidity guised as vanity
