## Introduction and intuition building

Sudoku is a popular number-placement puzzle based on logic and combinatorics. The objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits such that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 (once and only once). Usually the puzzle is partially filled in a way that guarantees a unique solution, as of now from what we know atleast 17 cues are needed to create a puzzle with a unique solution.
