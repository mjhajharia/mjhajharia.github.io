This is Meenal, my pronouns are She/Her. I’m a 19 year old junior at University of Delhi, majoring in CS and math. Academically, my interests are centered around Computational Geometry and Spectral Graph theory in the design and analysis of Discrete Algorithms, their utilities in representation learning. These days I’m thinking about Manifold Learning with applications in Computational Linguistics and Algorithmic Fairness.
