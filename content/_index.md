This is Meenal, my pronouns are She/Her. I’m a 19 year old junior at University of Delhi, majoring in CS and math. Academically, my broad interests are <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Theory and Algorithms</span>, <mark>Machine Learning (both theory and applications)</mark> and <mark>Probabilistic Computation</mark>. Specific areas or tools that intrigue me are Computational Geometry and Spectral Graph theory; I care about their utilities in design and analysis of Discrete Algorithms, representation learning, computational linguistics and algorithmic fairness.
