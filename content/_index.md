This is Meenal, my pronouns are She/Her. I’m a 19 year old junior at University of Delhi, majoring in CS and math. Academically, I'm interested in <span style="background-color: #c1c4c9">Theory and Algorithms, Machine Learning, Probabilistic Computation and Computational Linguistics</span>. Tools or specific areas that intrigue me are Computational geometry and Spectral Graph theory, I like to think about about their utilities in design and analysis of Discrete Algorithms, representation learning, and algorithmic fairness.
