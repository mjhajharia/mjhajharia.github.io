I’m a 19 year old junior at University of Delhi, majoring in CS and Math. I'm broadly interested in Theory and Algorithms. Specifically, Computational Geometry and Spectral Graph theory, I like to think about their utilities in the design and analysis of discrete algorithms, Computational Linguistics, Representation Learning and Algorithmic fairness. Additionally, I try to understand probabilistic computation and contribute to PyMC, this summer I'll be working on transforms for constrained parameters in HMC sampling. In that regard, I am working as a TA for Aki's Bayesian Data Analysis course, do sign up if you're a student interested in Probabilistic methods!
