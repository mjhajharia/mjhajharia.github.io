I’m a 19 year old junior at University of Delhi, majoring in CS and Math. I'm broadly interested in Algorithms and Theory of Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Statistical Learning. These interests are based on my general affinity for computational geometry, spectral graph theory and an attempt to deeply understand mathematical frameworks behind computation.


Alongside, I dabble in probabilistic computation and contribute to PyMC, this summer I'll be working on transforms for constrained parameters in HMC sampling with Bob Carpenter at [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics/). In that regard, I am also involved as a head TA in [Aki's Bayesian Data Analysis course, do sign up if you're a student interested in Probabilistic methods!](https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/gsu2022.html)
